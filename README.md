# Demonstration-of-Robot-Communication-On-Modbus-Using-C-Sharp
This is the Open Source application for Modbus Communication
The Modbus is the trusted name in the industrial automation communication domain. It is a pretty simple protocol to implement and so very popular to the industrial communication personnel. Nowadays, Some industrial robots are also capable of communicating through Modbus. So our robot researchers frequently face the challenge of communicating with Modbus-enabled devices or robots. They need to know the protocol in detail before integrating it into their project. Its learning curves are a bit higher because of the lack of document which is practical oriented. The protocol selection, packet structure, CRC, or LRC calculation need to maintain precisely as standards; otherwise, the Modbus exception may happen. We experience those scenarios. Through our practical experience, we learned what is required for a new researcher who wants to implement Modbus in their project. In this paper, we demonstrate the Modbus packet structure and implement it with a practical example. Finally, to test the written code, we provide simple tools which are easy to use and customizable. The researcher can easily integrate into their research project.
